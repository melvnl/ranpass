### Short Explanation

I believe the script and the repository description is very straight forward.

the script basically:

1. ask for user inputs
2. do some calculation and then return the random password
3. automatically copied the random password to device clipboard

add the script to your .bashrc or .zshrc to make the experience of generating new strong password for your creds more seamless
